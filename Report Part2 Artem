Artem Kolomiiets Report Part 2
In this project I was responsible for creating to Product, Store and Not a Product Exception classes.
The product class’s functionality is to create a product with all the parameters, such as the product’s 
price, description, quantity etc. In the product class I also implemented the code for an optional 
functionality of project 3 – that gives the sellers the ability to hold a sale until a certain quantity of a 
product is purchased. The functionality of the store class is to store all products of that store, let the 
sellers create, edit or remove products from that store. The exception class checks that a seller will 
create a product with all the needed parameters present, otherwise throwing the exception. In addition 
to this, I modified the Seller class in order to fit in with the rest of the code for the project and added 
two methods and the constructor to fit the needs of our project. Apart from coding, I also helped in 
determining how some of the program should look, specifically the marketplace and dashboard.
If given the opportunity to start over, I would determine and design the flow of code and what the 
program should return given a user input from the very beginning, before starting to code the program. 
This might have prevented some issues between different classes not working with each other and 
therefore the team would have spent less time on modifying the code. This would have resulted in a 
more cohesive code. Starting with project 5, it will be important to determine from the very beginning 
where (which classes) all the features, such as GUI, network IO and concurrency have to be 
implemented. More team communication will also be vital.
