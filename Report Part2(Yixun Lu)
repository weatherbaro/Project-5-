In the option 3 chosen by our group, I am responsible for creating the Customer-related code. In the program I wrote,
users can play the role of customers in the official marketplace of the application to browse, learn about, and purchase products. 
After purchasing products, there will be a record of the purchase history, 
and customers can view the detailed information of the purchase records, products, and sellers.
Customers can also sort sellers by their total sales to facilitate personalized selection of merchants they are interested in.
To complete this program, I divided it into many classes to write. The most important one is Customers.java, 
which is used to implement customer viewing of purchase records and quantities, as well as their own balance.
In addition, customers can browse products directly and support keyword search and sorting according to specified characters.
Use.java and UserBase.java are used to provide data for customers to use. FileModule.java is a file module that implements loading and saving data from files.
With the Persistent interface, it can achieve persistence and loading of objects of any type. The remaining files are used to save purchase history and sorting，
just like Message.java，StatisticsModule.java and PurchaseHistory.java. 
The experience of writing this program is unforgettable for me. 
It was my first time writing such a long program, and I was a bit at a loss at the beginning. However,
after discussing with my teammates, I gradually found a direction and got into the zone. 
Although my part was mostly completed successfully, I didn't implement the optional features in my code, which is a bit regretful. 
I hope to add more interesting functions in Project 5 to make this program that I designed for the first time more dynamic. 
I will work harder to do better in Project 5.
