In team collaboration, each person is an independent individual, 
so creating a good team collaboration atmosphere is crucial.
Each member of the team is a cooperative partner, and we all cherish the time we spend together. Getting along with people requires time and effort. 
To create a good team collaboration atmosphere, we should not complain about others and try to bring positive energy to the team.
To make team members more familiar and understand each other better, we regularly organize meetings, giving everyone the opportunity to express their suggestions.
We actively evaluate everyone's suggestions, so that we can understand each other better and ensure that the work is carried out smoothly.
Having good intentions and enthusiasm is not enough for any team. We also need smooth information communication and emotional communication, 
as well as achieving consensus on setting goals and implementing work plans in all aspects.
